Data NFT Marketplace on Internet Computer Protocol

Overview

A decentralized data marketplace built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) where users can mint, trade, and monetize datasets as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform enables data creators to tokenize their valuable datasets and provide secure, verifiable data trading infrastructure.

üéØ Vision

Transform the way data is shared and monetized by creating a trustless, decentralized marketplace where data ownership is verifiable, transactions are transparent, and creators are fairly compensated through blockchain technology.
